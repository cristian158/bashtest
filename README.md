Trial bash scripts to learn the basic concepts.

<i>cleanarch.sh</i> is a script for software and full update automization after a clean Arch install. It uses bash functions to either install (pacman and yay), or build some packages. 

<i>.migrate</i> and <i>.baregit</i> are a work in progress to clone bare repository into home and keep track of certain files

Then couple of files for a coherent system (.Xresources, .bashrc, 30-touchpad.conf and dracula.qbtheme)
