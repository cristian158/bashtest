Trial bash scripts to learn the basic concepts.

<i>echo-name.sh</i> does nothing but to ask for a name and copy it (echo) to a .txt

<i>cleanarch.sh</i> is a script for software and full update automization after a clean Arch install. It uses bash functions to either install (pacman and yay), or build some packages. 

<i>cleanarch-raw.sh</i> is essentially the same but without using bash functions resulting in more than 2x amount of code lines.
